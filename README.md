This app utilizes the Extracta API to extract data from the receipt images and the Vatlayer API to fetch all necessary information about the company stated on the receipt. The main goal of this app is to make the lives of the accounting teams a bit easier :) Sometimes you'd get a receipt instead of a completed invoice or PO. This is the point you realize you gonna spend a lot of time on additionaal information to get all the needed data. My app gets that data automatically, which eliminates unnesesary process of sending and getting emails until you get everything you need.
